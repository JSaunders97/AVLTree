# AVLTree

An AVL (**A**delson-**V**elsky and **L**andis) self-balancing binary search tree written in Java. AVL Trees are advantageous because values may be searched for and inserted in *O(log n )* time on average and in the worst case.

## Usage

The AVLTree class has 3 public methods, **print**, **insert** and **inTree**. Example usage is given [here]. 

* **print**, prints out the tree to the console, with the indent representing the depth of the value in the tree and left children coming before right children.

* **insert**, inserts the given value into the tree and rebalances as needed.

* **inTree**, test if the given value is in the tree.
